<p>
    Once you have your face and font objects configured as desired and
    your input buffer is filled with the characters you need to shape,
    all you need to do is call <code class="function">hb_shape()</code>.
  </p>
<p>
    HarfBuzz will return the shaped version of the text in the same
    buffer that you provided, but it will be in output mode. At that
    point, you can iterate through the glyphs in the buffer, drawing
    each one at the specified position or handing them off to the
    appropriate graphics library.
  </p>
<p>
    For the most part, HarfBuzz's shaping step is straightforward from
    the outside. But that doesn't mean there will never be cases where
    you want to look under the hood and see what is happening on the
    inside. HarfBuzz provides facilities for doing that, too.
  </p>
<div class="section">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="shaping-buffer-output"></a>Shaping and buffer output</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
      The <code class="function">hb_shape()</code> function call takes four arguments: the font
      object to use, the buffer of characters to shape, an array of
      user-specified features to apply, and the length of that feature
      array. The feature array can be NULL, so for the sake of
      simplicity we will start with that case.
    </p>
<p>
      Internally, HarfBuzz looks  at the tables of the font file to
      determine where glyph classes, substitutions, and positioning
      are defined, using that information to decide which
      <span class="emphasis"><em>shaper</em></span> to use (<code class="literal">ot</code> for
      OpenType fonts, <code class="literal">aat</code> for Apple Advanced
      Typography fonts, and so on). It also looks at the direction,
      script, and language properties of the segment to figure out
      which script-specific shaping model is needed (at least, in
      shapers that support multiple options).      
    </p>
<p>
      If a font has a GDEF table, then that is used for
      glyph classes; if not, HarfBuzz will fall back to Unicode
      categorization by code point. If a font has an AAT "morx" table,
      then it is used for substitutions; if not, but there is a GSUB
      table, then the GSUB table is used. If the font has an AAT
      "kerx" table, then it is used for positioning; if not, but
      there is a GPOS table, then the GPOS table is used. If neither
      table is found, but there is a "kern" table, then HarfBuzz will
      use the "kern" table. If there is no "kerx", no GPOS, and no
      "kern", HarfBuzz will fall back to positioning marks itself.
    </p>
<p>
      With a well-behaved OpenType font, you expect GDEF, GSUB, and
      GPOS tables to all be applied. HarfBuzz implements the
      script-specific shaping models in internal functions, rather
      than in the public API.
    </p>
<p>
      The algorithms
      used for complex scripts can be quite involved; HarfBuzz tries
      to be compatible with the OpenType Layout specification
      and, wherever there is any ambiguity, HarfBuzz attempts to replicate the
      output of Microsoft's Uniscribe engine. See the <a class="ulink" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/script-development/standard" target="_top">Microsoft
      Typography pages</a> for more detail.
    </p>
<p>
      In general, though, all that you need to know is that
      <code class="function">hb_shape()</code> returns the results of shaping
      in the same buffer that you provided. The buffer's content type
      will now be set to
      <code class="literal">HB_BUFFER_CONTENT_TYPE_GLYPHS</code>, indicating
      that it contains shaped output, rather than input text. You can
      now extract the glyph information and positioning arrays:
    </p>
<pre class="programlisting">
      hb_glyph_info_t *glyph_info    = hb_buffer_get_glyph_infos(buf, &amp;glyph_count);
      hb_glyph_position_t *glyph_pos = hb_buffer_get_glyph_positions(buf, &amp;glyph_count);
    </pre>
<p>
      The glyph information array holds a <span class="type">hb_glyph_info_t</span>
      for each output glyph, which has two fields:
      <em class="parameter"><code>codepoint</code></em> and
      <em class="parameter"><code>cluster</code></em>. Whereas, in the input buffer,
      the <em class="parameter"><code>codepoint</code></em> field contained the Unicode
      code point, it now contains the glyph ID of the corresponding
      glyph in the font. The <em class="parameter"><code>cluster</code></em> field is
      an integer that you can use to help identify when shaping has
      reordered, split, or combined code points; we will say more
      about that in the next chapter.
    </p>
<p>
      The glyph positions array holds a corresponding
      <span class="type">hb_glyph_position_t</span> for each output glyph,
      containing four fields: <em class="parameter"><code>x_advance</code></em>,
      <em class="parameter"><code>y_advance</code></em>,
      <em class="parameter"><code>x_offset</code></em>, and
      <em class="parameter"><code>y_offset</code></em>. The advances tell you how far
      you need to move the drawing point after drawing this glyph,
      depending on whether you are setting horizontal text (in which
      case you will have x advances) or vertical text (for which you
      will have y advances). The x and y offsets tell you where to
      move to start drawing the glyph; usually you will have both and
      x and a y offset, regardless of the text direction.
    </p>
<p>
      Most of the time, you will rely on a font-rendering library or
      other graphics library to do the actual drawing of glyphs, so
      you will need to iterate through the glyphs in the buffer and
      pass the corresponding values off.
