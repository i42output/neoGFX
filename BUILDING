* Boost (currently assumed to be in /usr/local)
* OpenSSL (currently assumed to be in /usr/local)
* zlib (currently assumed to be in /usr/local)
* Freetype (set environment variable "DevDirFreetype" to point to directory root of library)
* Glew (set environment variable "DevDirGlew" to point to directory root of library)

neoGFX is also dependent on the following library:
